Using functions/methods as first class citizens

it is going to let you use the functions or methods as first class citizens.

What does it mean is that functional programming is going to let you create a function and assign that functionality

to a variable and pass it around as like method parameters. This was never possible before Java 8. This is an excellent addition to Java8.
