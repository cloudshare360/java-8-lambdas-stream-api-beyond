The image compares the key features introduced in **Java 8** and those introduced in **Java 9 and beyond**. Below is a detailed breakdown of the content:

---

### **Left Column: Java 8**
- **Lambdas**: 
  - Lambdas are anonymous functions that allow for more concise and functional-style programming. They enable developers to write code in a more declarative manner, reducing boilerplate.
  
- **Streams**:
  - Streams provide a way to process collections of data in a functional style. They support operations like filtering, mapping, reducing, and more, enabling efficient and expressive data processing.

- **Optionals**:
  - Optionals are a container object that may or may not contain a value. They help avoid `null` pointer exceptions by providing a safer way to handle optional values.

- **New Date/Time APIs**:
  - Java 8 introduced a modern date and time API (`java.time`) to replace the older `Date` and `Calendar` classes. This new API is more intuitive, thread-safe, and comprehensive, supporting various date and time manipulations.

### **Right Column: Java 9 & Beyond**
- **Java Platform Module System (JPMS)**:
  - Introduced in Java 9, JPMS brings modularity to the Java platform. It allows developers to define modules with explicit dependencies, improving encapsulation, security, and maintainability.

- **Local Variable Type Inference (LVTI)**:
  - Introduced in Java 10, LVTI allows developers to use the keyword `var` for local variable declarations, where the type is inferred from the initialization expression. This reduces redundancy and improves code readability.

- **Record Types**:
  - Introduced in Java 16, record types simplify the creation of classes that are logically data carriers. They automatically generate boilerplate code such as constructors, getters, `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString`.

- **Enhanced Switch**:
  - Enhanced switch statements were introduced in Java 12 and further improved in subsequent versions. They support pattern matching, multiple case labels, and yield expressions, making them more powerful and flexible.

- **TextBlocks**:
  - Introduced in Java 15, text blocks allow developers to write multi-line string literals using triple quotes (`"""`). This eliminates the need for escape characters and improves the readability of strings containing multiple lines.

- **Sealed Classes**:
  - Introduced in Java 17, sealed classes restrict which other classes can extend or implement them. This enhances control over class hierarchies and improves type safety.

- **Pattern Matching**:
  - Pattern matching was enhanced in Java 14 and further developed in later versions. It allows developers to match patterns in switch statements and other contexts, enabling more expressive and concise code.

- **Virtual Threads**:
  - Virtual threads (also known as "fibers") were introduced in Java 21. They provide lightweight threading that can scale to millions of concurrent tasks without the overhead of traditional threads. This feature is particularly useful for high-concurrency applications.

### **Summary**
- **Java 8** focuses on foundational modernization with functional programming concepts (Lambdas, Streams), improved null handling (Optionals), and a modern date/time API.
- **Java 9 and beyond** introduce significant advancements in modularity (JPMS), type inference (LVTI), simplified class definitions (Record Types), enhanced control flow (Enhanced Switch), improved string handling (TextBlocks), better type safety (Sealed Classes), pattern matching, and high-performance concurrency (Virtual Threads).

This comparison highlights how Java has evolved from introducing core functional programming features in Java 8 to enhancing modularity, expressiveness, and performance in subsequent versions.
