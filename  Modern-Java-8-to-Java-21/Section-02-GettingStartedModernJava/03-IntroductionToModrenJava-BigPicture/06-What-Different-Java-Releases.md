### **Key Takeaways for Developers**
1. **Focus on LTS Releases:** 
   - Use LTS releases (Java 8, 11, 17, 21) for production environments due to their extended support and stability.
   - LTS releases are ideal for long-term projects where maintenance and security updates are critical.

2. **Preview Features:**
   - Pay attention to preview features (e.g., Virtual Threads, Pattern Matching, Structured Concurrency) in non-LTS releases. These often become stable in future LTS versions.

3. **Deprecations:**
   - Be aware of deprecated APIs (e.g., Nashorn, AWT Printing, `sun.misc.Unsafe`, `java.util.logging`) and plan migrations to alternatives.

4. **New Features:**
   - Stay updated with new features like:
     - **Virtual Threads** (for lightweight concurrency).
     - **Pattern Matching** (for more expressive code).
     - **Structured Concurrency** (for better thread management).
