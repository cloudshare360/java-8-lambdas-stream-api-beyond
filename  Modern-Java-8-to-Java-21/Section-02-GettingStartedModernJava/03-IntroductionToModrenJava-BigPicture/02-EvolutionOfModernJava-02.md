The provided text summarizes key milestones in the evolution of Java, focusing on releases from **Java SE 8** to **Java SE 21**. Below is a detailed breakdown of the content:

---

### **Modern Era:**
#### **Java SE 8 (March 2014):**
- **Key Features:**
  - Introduced **lambda expressions**, enabling functional programming paradigms.
  - Introduced the **Stream API**, providing a powerful way to process collections of data in a declarative and functional style.
  - Introduced a **new Date/Time API** (`java.time`), replacing the older `Date` and `Calendar` classes with a more modern, thread-safe, and comprehensive API.

#### **Java SE 9 (September 2017):**
- **Key Features:**
  - Brought the **module system (Project Jigsaw)**, which introduced modularity to the Java platform through the **Java Platform Module System (JPMS)**.
  - Introduced **JShell**, an interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) tool for experimenting with Java code interactively.

#### **Java SE 10 (March 2018):**
- **Key Feature:**
  - Introduced **local-variable type inference** using the `var` keyword, allowing developers to declare local variables without explicitly specifying their types.

#### **Java SE 11 (September 2018):**
- **Key Features:**
  - An **LTS (Long-Term Support)** release.
  - Added new features like the **HTTP Client API**, providing a modern HTTP client library.
  - Removed deprecated modules such as Java EE and CORBA modules, streamlining the core Java platform.

#### **Java SE 12 through Java SE 16 (2019–2021):**
- **Key Features:**
  - These versions introduced various enhancements, including:
    - **Switch expressions**: A more concise and expressive way to write switch statements.
    - **Text blocks**: Simplified multi-line string literals using triple quotes (`"""`).
    - **Records**: A concise way to define classes that are logically data carriers, reducing boilerplate code.
    - **Pattern matching**: Enhanced support for pattern matching in switch statements and other contexts.

### **Recent Long-Term Support Releases:**

#### **Java SE 17 (September 2021):**
- **Key Features:**
  - An **LTS (Long-Term Support)** release.
  - Included features like:
    - **Sealed classes**: Control over which classes can extend or implement a given class or interface.
    - **Enhanced pattern matching**: Further improvements to pattern matching capabilities.

#### **Java SE 21 (September 2023):**
- **Key Features:**
  - The **latest LTS release**.
  - Continued the tradition of:
    - **Performance improvements**: Enhancements to runtime performance and efficiency.
    - **New language features**: Introducing innovative features to make Java more expressive and powerful.

### **Summary of Key Points:**
1. **Java SE 8 (2014):** Functional programming (lambdas, streams), new Date/Time API.
2. **Java SE 9 (2017):** Modularity (JPMS), JShell.
3. **Java SE 10 (2018):** Local variable type inference (`var`).
4. **Java SE 11 (2018):** LTS release with HTTP Client API, removal of deprecated modules.
5. **Java SE 12–16 (2019–2021):** Switch expressions, text blocks, records, pattern matching.
6. **Java SE 17 (2021):** LTS release with sealed classes and enhanced pattern matching.
7. **Java SE 21 (2023):** Latest LTS release, focusing on performance improvements and new features.

This timeline highlights how Java has evolved to become more modular, expressive, and efficient over time.
