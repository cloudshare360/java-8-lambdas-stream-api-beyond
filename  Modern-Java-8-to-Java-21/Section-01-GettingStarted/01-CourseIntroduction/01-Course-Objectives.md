The image shows the **Course Objectives** for a Java course that focuses on modern features introduced in Java 8 and beyond. Below is a detailed breakdown of the content:

---

### **Course Objectives**
1. **Overview of Coverage:**
   - The course covers all the new features in Modern Java, starting from **Java 8** and extending to features introduced in versions beyond Java 8.

2. **Structure of the Course:**
   - The course is divided into two main parts:
     - **Part 1: New Modern Java Features in Java 8**
       - This part focuses on features introduced in Java 8, including:
         - **Functional Programming:** Emphasizes programming paradigms centered around functions.
         - **Lambdas:** Enables concise expression of anonymous functions.
         - **Streams:** Provides a way to process collections of data in a declarative and functional style.
         - **Optionals:** A container object that may or may not contain a non-null value, used to avoid `null` checks.
         - **New Date/Time APIs:** Introduces a modern date and time API (`java.time`) to replace the older `Date` and `Calendar` classes.
         - And more...

     - **Part 2: New Features in the Modern Java since Java 9**
       - This part covers features introduced in Java versions after Java 9, including:
         - **Local Variable Type Inference (LVTI):** Allows the use of `var` for local variable declarations, inferring the type automatically.
         - **Record Types:** Simplifies the creation of classes that are logically data carriers with minimal boilerplate code.
         - **Enhanced Switch:** Provides more powerful and flexible switch statements, including pattern matching support.
         - **TextBlocks:** Simplifies multi-line string literals using triple quotes (`"""`).
         - **Sealed Classes:** Introduces sealed types to control which classes can extend or implement a given class or interface.
         - **Pattern Matching:** Enhances the ability to match patterns in switch statements and other contexts.
         - **JPMS (Java Platform Module System):** Manages dependencies and encapsulation in large-scale applications.
         - And more...

3. **Continuous Updates:**
   - The course will be continuously updated to include all new features as they are released in future versions of Java.

4. **Hands-On Learning:**
   - All concepts will be explored through actual coding exercises, ensuring practical application and understanding of the features.

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Focus on Modern Java:** The course emphasizes modern Java features, starting from Java 8 and extending to newer versions.
- **Structured Approach:** The course is divided into two parts for better organization:
  - Part 1: Java 8 features.
  - Part 2: Features introduced since Java 9.
- **Practical Learning:** The course prioritizes hands-on coding to reinforce learning.
- **Future-Proof Content:** Continuous updates ensure that learners stay current with the latest Java developments.

This course is ideal for developers looking to deepen their understanding of modern Java features and apply them effectively in real-world scenarios.
